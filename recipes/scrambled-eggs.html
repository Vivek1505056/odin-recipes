        <p>Nutrious, high protien breakfast</p>

        <p>Scrambled eggs are a classic, versatile breakfast dish made by cooking beaten eggs in a pan until they are set into soft, creamy curds. I love scrambled eggs. I have been eating them for breakfast every single day for over 5 years and they were a staple in my diet when I lost over 50 pounds!</p>
